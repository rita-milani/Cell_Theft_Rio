## Cell Theft in Rio de Janeiro
In this project, we are going to work with a database containing data about violence in the state and city of Rio de Janeiro. The data was obtained from ISP Dados, organized by the Institute of Public Security from Rio de Janeiro. The database contains series about theft, homicide, hijack and others, and due to the size, we are going to select a specific topic to work with ahead.

As part of DSNP course, the aim of this project is to learn how to manipulate data in Pandas library, executing basic commands that are easily used in Excel, but require further coding skills in Python, like:

Analyze database characteristics
Adjust dates
Remove unnecessary colums
Select desired sets of rows and columns
Select and work with specific series in a new DF
Work with specific attributes as mean, max, min, moving average, percent change and so on.
